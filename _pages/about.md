This EM [image](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=image-9822151)
of SARS-Cov2 in the human intestine ([Lamers etal Science
2020](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc1669)) is over 79360 x 167424 pixels.
It has been converted to the
[OME-Zarr](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/) format, so that individual
chunks of raw pixel data can be loaded in parallel into the browser, and viewed
with [Vizarr](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vizarr/).
